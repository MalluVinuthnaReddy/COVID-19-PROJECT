## **Dataset:**

The dataset, "covid_19_clean_complete.csv": Contains columns countries, confirmed, recovered, deaths, active, date, State, WHO Region, Latitude, Longitude.

## **Analysis Performed:**

1. **Overall Covid Cases:** Visualized the total number of cases all over world.Number of cases vs Days since the first suspect.
2. **Overall Covid Cases of Individual Country:** visualized the total number of cases in each country. Number of cases vs Days since the first suspect.

## **Tools Used:**
**Python:** The primary language for data processing and analysis.      
**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.                       
**NumPy:** For numerical operations and array processing.  
**Matplotlib:** For data visualization and creating charts.  
**scikit-learn:** For feature scaling and transformations.
