#COVID-Trend-Analysis-using-Python-Libraries

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 trends using Python. By leveraging various data sources and Python libraries, we will visualize and interpret the impact of COVID-19 over time, considering factors like case counts, vaccination rates, and government policies.

And so on...

##**Dataset**
The dataset, "covid_19_clean_complete.csv": Contains columns countries, confirmed, recovered, deaths, active, date, State, WHO Region, Latitude, Longitude.

##**Analyses Performed**
1. Overall Covid Cases: Visualized the total number of cases all over world.Number of cases vs Days since the first suspect.
2. Overall Covid Cases of Individual Country: visualized the total number of cases in each country. Number of cases vs Days since the first suspect.

##**Tools Used**
Python: The primary language for data processing and analysis.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array processing.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and creating charts.
scikit-learn: For feature scaling and transformations.
